# General Overview

All code is written in Python. 

The folder stochastic_pgfs holds all functions for creating generating functions of an arbitrary degree distribution, and the Laub-Xia sensitivity metric. 

The folder scripts then has different files to implement each of these functions for a negative binomial, Poisson and power-law distribution.
