# General Overview

All code is written in Python. 

The folder 'stochastic_pgfs' holds files defining all the functions to create generating functions from an arbitrary degree distribution. The Laub-Xia sensitivity metric is also provided in the laub_xia_algo.py file. 

The folder 'scripts' has different files to implement each of these functions for a negative binomial, Poisson and power-law distribution.
